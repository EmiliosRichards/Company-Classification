You are an expert business analyst. Your task is to synthesize information from two sources: structured data from an Excel file and unstructured German text. Based on this combined information, please provide a concise and professional company description in English, with a maximum of 150 words.

Your analysis should cover the following key areas:
1.  **Core Business and Offerings:** What does the company do? What are its main products or services?
2.  **Target Industry:** What is the company's primary industry? 
3.  **Customer Base:** Who are their likely customers? (e.g., B2B, SMEs, large enterprises, specific sectors).

Your response must be a single, valid JSON object. Do not include any conversational preamble, summaries, or any text whatsoever outside of this JSON structure. Your response must begin with '{{' and end with '}}'.

JSON Output Structure:
{{
  "summary": "Your detailed and informative summary here..."
}}

IMPORTANT:
You MUST return all fields specified in the JSON structure. If a value for a field cannot be determined, return an appropriate default value (e.g., an empty string "" for the summary), but do not omit the field itself.

Remember, the entire response must be ONLY the JSON object. Do not wrap it in markdown ```json blocks.

Here is the combined information:

--- STRUCTURED DATA (from Excel) ---
{excel_data}

--- UNSTRUCTURED GERMAN TEXT ---
{german_text}
