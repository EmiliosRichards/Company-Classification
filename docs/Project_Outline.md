# ðŸš€ Manuav Classification and Lead Generation Project

## ðŸŽ¯ Step 1: Define Clear Objectives and Classification Criteria

### 1. **Identify Primary and Secondary Objectives**

**Primary Objective:**

Classify approximately 80,000 German, Austrian, and Swiss companies by their similarity to Manuavâ€™s existing 70 successful partner companies, enabling targeted and persuasive lead generation.

**Secondary Objectives (Long-term Strategic):**

* Develop a scalable and repeatable analytical pipeline.
* Support future strategic decisions, including potential company acquisitions.

---

### 2. **Explicit Definition of "Similarity"**

Clearly articulate how similarity should be interpreted in your business context. Prioritize criteria for initial iterations and expand subsequently:

| Dimension             | Explanation & Examples                                          | Importance      |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| **Industry**          | Manufacturing, IT services, healthcare tech, SaaS               | **High**        |
| **Products/Services** | Digitized onboarding solutions, WiFi as a service               | **High**        |
| **Customer Types**    | Niche B2B segments (specialized markets, complex buyers)        | **High**        |
| **Company Size**      | SMEs (ideally with at least 1000 initial B2B leads for calling) | **Medium/High** |
| **Business Model**    | SaaS, subscription-based, consulting, hardware sales            | **Medium**      |
| **Innovation Level**  | Advanced technology usage (AI-driven, automation, IoT)          | **Medium**      |
| **Geographic Reach**  | Regional, national, international                               | **Low/Medium**  |

**Initial Priority:** Industry, Products/Services, Customer Types/Niche.

---

### 3. **Practical Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)**

Clearly define characteristics of your ideal partners to streamline classification:

**Ideal Customer Profile (ICP):**

* B2B companies with innovative or specialized products/services.
* Clearly defined niche markets, preferably those that are difficult to penetrate.
* Small-to-medium-sized enterprises (efficient and impactful for Manuavâ€™s call-center interactions).
* Quantifiable lead potential (ideally >1000 B2B leads, flexible).

**Example ICP Matches:**

* **CareMates.de**: Specialized nicheâ€”digitizing nursing home admission.
* **RECOS.de**: IT services with predictable monthly pricing tailored for SMEs.

---

### 4. **Practical Use of Classification Results**

Clearly define how the classification results will enhance Manuavâ€™s sales and marketing operations:

* **Sales Scripts Enhancement:**

  * Generate specific examples for persuasive sales calls.
  * *Example Script:* "We've successfully collaborated with companies similar to yours, such as CareMates.de, helping them digitize onboarding processes and achieve 80% efficiency improvements."

* **Tailored Marketing Materials:**

  * Develop targeted case studies, brochures, and personalized email campaigns.

* **Prioritized Lead Outreach:**

  * Companies with higher similarity rankings receive priority during call-center campaigns.

---

### 5. **Metrics for Project Success Evaluation**

Clearly define actionable metrics to assess the success of this classification project:

| Metric                      | How to Measure?                                   | Success Criteria               |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Lead Conversion Rate**    | Percentage of leads converted to meetings/clients | At least 10% improvement       |
| **Classification Accuracy** | Internal expert validation feedback               | At least 80% internal approval |
| **Sales Efficiency**        | Reduction in lead-to-client acquisition time      | Improvement by at least 15%    |

---

### 6. **Documentation and Stakeholder Alignment**

Clearly document these definitions in a concise project charter or internal knowledge base, ensuring alignment and agreement among all stakeholders:

**Project Charter Outline:**

```yaml
PROJECT CHARTER: Manuav Classification and Lead Generation Project

This finalized and structured plan will set a clear foundation for intelligent, thorough, and effective execution of the subsequent stages.



Standardized Categories for Business Model

From your Step 1 and common business models, here's a good starting set. We'll aim to pick the primary model(s) if multiple are mentioned.

SaaS (Software as a Service): Characterized by subscription-based software, often cloud-hosted.
Consulting: Providing expert advice, strategy, and often implementation guidance.
Service-Oriented (General): Broader category for companies providing services that aren't strictly consulting or SaaS (e.g., managed IT services, recruitment, training, logistics).
Project-Based: Work delivered in discrete projects, often customized (common with consulting and some service-oriented businesses).
Product-Driven (Software): Selling software licenses or on-premise software products (distinct from SaaS).
Product-Driven (Physical/Hardware): Selling physical goods, machinery, devices, etc.
Platform-Based: Facilitating interactions or transactions between different user groups (e.g., marketplaces, social networks, some SaaS can also be platforms).
Subscription (Non-SaaS): Recurring revenue for non-software products or services (e.g., content subscriptions, some managed services).
Reseller/Integrator: Selling and/or integrating third-party products/services.
Franchise: Licensing a business model and brand to franchisees.
E-commerce: Primarily selling products online.
Manufacturing: Producing physical goods.
Agency: (Often marketing, design, advertising) - typically project-based and service-oriented.
PaaS (Platform as a Service - for tech): Providing a platform for developing, running, and managing applications.
IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service - for tech): Providing virtualized computing resources over the internet.
Platform-Based / Marketplace: (Connecting users, providing a core platform for interaction/tools; often SaaS if the platform is the software)
Training / Education Provider: (Focus on delivering courses, workshops, educational content)
Freemium: (Core product free, premium paid features/version)
Wholesale / Distribution / Retail: (Focused on selling products, potentially others')
Hybrid (e.g., SaaS / Consulting): (Used when two models are very distinct and equally prominent. I will try to be concise.)


Define Standardized Categories for Company Size

Based on your ICP (Ideal Customer Profile) from Step 1 and general business understanding, let's establish some categories. You mentioned: "Small-to-medium-sized enterprises (efficient and impactful for Manuavâ€™s call-center interactions)."

Here's a suggested set of categories. We can adjust if needed:

Micro: (Typically 1-9 employees, often startups or sole proprietorships with a few helpers)
Small: (Typically 10-49 employees)
Medium: (Typically 50-249 employees)
SME (General): (Use this if "SME" or "Mittelstand" is explicitly mentioned, or strongly implied by multiple factors but specific numbers are missing. This can encompass Small and Medium.)
Large: (Typically 250+ employees)
Startup: (Explicitly stated as startup, or very new, small founding team, pilot phase)
Sole Proprietorship: (e.K. legal form, or "owner-led" with no other team indication)
Unknown/Not Specified: (When no reliable indicator is present)


Standardized Industry Categories Used:
Here's a list of the categories I'll be using. This helps ensure consistency. Some categories might have a specific focus noted in parentheses if it's a strong theme.

Unknown / Not Specified: No clear or sufficient indication of geographic reach.



Standardized Customer Target Segment Categories I Will Use:

This list will be a bit more granular than previous ones to capture common B2B target groups. If a company targets multiple distinct segments, I may list them separated by a semicolon.

B2B (General): Used when "B2B," "companies," or "businesses" is stated without further significant qualification.
SMEs (Small & Medium Enterprises): Explicitly targets SMEs or Mittelstand.
Large Enterprises: Explicitly targets large corporations, enterprise-level clients.

Specific Industries (B2B):
Healthcare Sector (B2B) (e.g., hospitals, clinics, care facilities, pharma companies as clients)
Manufacturing Sector (B2B)
Automotive Sector (B2B)
Logistics & Supply Chain Sector (B2B)
Retail Sector (B2B)
Hospitality Sector (B2B) (e.g., hotels, restaurants as clients)
Real Estate / Construction Sector (B2B)
Financial Services Sector (B2B) (e.g., banks, insurance companies as clients)
Legal Sector (B2B) (e.g., law firms, notary offices)
Tax / Accounting Sector (B2B) (e.g., tax advisors, accounting firms)
IT / Tech Companies (B2B) (Selling to other tech companies)
Public Sector / Government (B2B)
Energy Sector (B2B)
Media / Publishing Sector (B2B)
Education Sector (B2B) (e.g., schools, universities as clients)
Skilled Trades / Crafts (B2B)
Aerospace / Aviation Sector (B2B)

Startups (B2B): Explicitly targets startups as customers.
Non-Profits / Associations (B2B):
Service Providers (B2B General): Targets other service-providing businesses.
B2C (Business to Consumer): If the primary focus is selling directly to individual consumers (less common in your dataset, but will note if present).
Practitioners (B2C/B2B): (e.g., individual doctors, therapists, alternative health practitioners - can have elements of both B2B and B2C depending on context).
Unknown / Not Specified:

I will prioritize specific industries if mentioned. If it's general SMEs across industries, "SMEs" will be used.





ADDITIONAL THOUGHTS ON STANDARDIZATION:

Okay great thanks, based on the table, which other columns would benefit from standardization? Which columns should we leave verbose for nlp? Anything else we should add, for instance nace codes?
ThinkingThoughts


Okay, that's a great question. Now that Industry and Company Size are getting standardized, let's look at the other columns.

Columns to Prioritize for Standardization:

BusinBusiness Model (Original Column)
Why: Similar to industry and size, having standardized categories for how a company operates (e.g., SaaS, Consulting, Product-Driven, Service-Oriented, Subscription, Project-Based, Marketplace, Freemium) will be very useful for filtering, analysis, and as a feature in your similarity model.
Action:
Define your standard categories (you likely have these from your Step 1 project outline).
Create a new column, e.g., Business_Model_Category.
Go through the original Business Model text for each of your 70 partners and map it to one of your standard categories in the new column. For example:
"Software solution provider (likely SaaS given the nature of the offering...)" -> SaaS
"Service-oriented; Project-based consulting..." -> Service-Oriented; Project-Based (you can decide if you want to allow multiple, separated by a semicolon, or pick the most primary).
"SaaS (implied by "platform" and "cloud solution")" -> SaaS


Geographic Reach
Why: The current entries are descriptive but varied (e.g., "National (Germany, based in Kassel)," "Germany (Headquartered in AltomÃ¼nster...)," "Global presence; Branches worldwide"). Standardizing this will make it easier to compare and filter.
Action:
Define standard categories: e.g., Regional (Germany), National (Germany), DACH, Europe (Wider), Global, Other National (Specify), Unknown/Not Specified.
Create a new column, e.g., Geographic_Reach_Category.
Map the current descriptions to these categories.
"National (Germany, based in Kassel)" -> National (Germany)
"Global presence; Branches worldwide" -> Global
If it just says "Germany", that's National (Germany).


Columns to Leave Verbose (Primarily for NLP):
These columns contain rich, nuanced text that is crucial for the NLP-based similarity matching. Standardizing them too much would strip away valuable information.


Products/Services Offered: Absolutely critical for NLP. The specific details of what a company offers are key to finding true similarities.

USP (Unique Selling Proposition) / Key Selling Points: Also vital for NLP. This captures the unique differentiators and how they position themselves.

Customer Target Segments (Original Column): While you could try to extract very high-level segments (e.g., B2B, B2C, SME, Enterprise), the specific niche descriptions (e.g., "Production companies; Service providers. (Mentions clients like Pfizer Pharma GmbH and Stadler Deutschland, suggesting capability to serve larger enterprises)") are extremely valuable for NLP.
Optional Hybrid Approach: You could create an additional column for high-level tags if obvious patterns emerge (e.g., Customer_Type_Tags with values like "SME; Enterprise; Healthcare"), but ensure the original verbose text remains untouched for NLP.


Innovation Level Indicators (Original Column): The descriptions here (e.g., "Use of LEGOÂ® SERIOUS PLAYÂ® (described as "innovative workshops" for creative problem-solving); Focus on "future-oriented" leadership concepts...") provide context that simple categories might miss.
Potential Feature Engineering Later: From this text, you might later extract keywords (e.g., "AI," "digitization," "IoT," "automation") or create binary flags (e.g., Uses_AI_Indicator: TRUE/FALSE) during Step 3 (Feature Engineering), but keep the full text for now.


Columns That Are Generally Fine (or Already Addressed):

Company Name: Identifier.
Industry (Original): Keep as is, you now have Industry_Category_Standardized.
Company Size Indicators (Original): Keep as is, you now have Company_Size_Category.
Website, Email, Phone: These are contact details. Ensure phone numbers are cleaned of notes/placeholders as discussed. Otherwise, their format is relatively standard.
Source Document Section/Notes: Internal metadata.
Is_Successful_Partner: Already a clean boolean.

Should You Add NACE Codes (or similar, like SIC codes)?

Yes, absolutely, if feasible.

What are they? NACE (Statistical Classification of Economic Activities in the European Community) or SIC (Standard Industrial Classification) codes are standardized numerical codes assigned to businesses based on their primary economic activity.

Benefits:
Industry Standard: Provides a widely recognized and objective classification.
Hierarchical: NACE codes are hierarchical, allowing you to group industries at different levels of granularity (e.g., from broad sectors down to very specific activities).
Comparability: Excellent for comparing your dataset with external market data or official statistics.
Data Enrichment: Many business databases (like Bureau van Dijk, Dun & Bradstreet, or even some public company registries) provide NACE/SIC codes.

How to Add Them:
Create a New Column: e.g., NACE_Code and potentially NACE_Description.
Obtaining the Codes (for your 70 partners):
Manual Lookup: For 70 companies, you might be able to manually look them up if you have access to a business directory that includes them, or sometimes from their official company registration details (if you know where to find those for German companies, e.g., Handelsregister, though NACE might not always be directly there). Official statistics offices sometimes provide tools or lists.
Company Websites: Sometimes companies list their NACE code in an "Imprint" or "Legal" section, but this is not very common.
Educated Guess & Mapping: Based on your Industry_Category_Standardized and Products/Services Offered, you can try to map them to the most appropriate NACE code. There are NACE code browsers online (e.g., Eurostat's RAMON). This requires some understanding of the NACE structure.


Consideration for the 80k Dataset: If you plan to use external data sources for the 80,000 companies, check if those sources can provide NACE codes. This would be a huge help for consistency.


Summary Table:
Column Name	Action Recommendation	Rationale
Business Model (Original)	Standardize into Business_Model_Category	Easier analysis, filtering, and feature for model.
Geographic Reach	Standardize into Geographic_Reach_Category	Easier analysis and filtering by location.
Products/Services Offered	Leave Verbose	Critical for NLP similarity; detail is key.
USP / Key Selling Points	Leave Verbose	Critical for NLP similarity; captures differentiation.
Customer Target Segments (Original)	Leave Verbose (Consider optional high-level tagging later if clear patterns emerge)	Niche details are important for NLP.
Innovation Level Indicators (Original)	Leave Verbose (Consider keyword extraction/binary flags later during feature engineering)	Descriptive text provides context; can be processed for features.
Other columns (Name, Contact, Original data)	Generally fine / Keep as raw reference	Serve as identifiers, contact info, or original state before standardization.
NEW ADDITION	Add NACE_Code and NACE_Description (if feasible)	Industry standard, good for broad categorization, comparability, and potential data enrichment.
