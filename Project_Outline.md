* Support future strategic decisions, including potential company acquisitions.

### 2. **Explicit Definition of "Similarity"**

Clearly articulate how similarity should be interpreted in your business context. Prioritize criteria for initial iterations and expand subsequently:

| Dimension             | Explanation & Examples                                          | Importance      |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| **Industry**          | Manufacturing, IT services, healthcare tech, SaaS               | **High**        |
| **Products/Services** | Digitized onboarding solutions, WiFi as a service               | **High**        |
| **Customer Types**    | Niche B2B segments (specialized markets, complex buyers)        | **High**        |
| **Company Size**      | SMEs (ideally with at least 1000 initial B2B leads for calling) | **Medium/High** |
| **Business Model**    | SaaS, subscription-based, consulting, hardware sales            | **Medium**      |
| **Innovation Level**  | Advanced technology usage (AI-driven, automation, IoT)          | **Medium**      |
| **Geographic Reach**  | Regional, national, international                               | **Low/Medium**  |

**Initial Priority:** Industry, Products/Services, Customer Types/Niche.

### 3. **Practical Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)**

Clearly define characteristics of your ideal partners to streamline classification:

**Ideal Customer Profile (ICP):**

* B2B companies with innovative or specialized products/services.
* Clearly defined niche markets, preferably those that are difficult to penetrate.
* Small-to-medium-sized enterprises (efficient and impactful for ManuAvâ€™s call-center interactions).
* Quantifiable lead potential (ideally >1000 B2B leads, flexible).

**Example ICP Matches:**

* **CareMates.de**: Specialized nicheâ€”digitizing nursing home admission.
* **RECOS.de**: IT services with predictable monthly pricing tailored for SMEs.

### 4. **Practical Use of Classification Results**

Clearly define how the classification results will enhance ManuAvâ€™s sales and marketing operations:

* **Sales Scripts Enhancement:**

  * Generate specific examples for persuasive sales calls.
  * *Example Script:* "We've successfully collaborated with companies similar to yours, such as CareMates.de, helping them digitize onboarding processes and achieve 80% efficiency improvements."

* **Tailored Marketing Materials:**

  * Develop targeted case studies, brochures, and personalized email campaigns.

* **Prioritized Lead Outreach:**

  * Companies with higher similarity rankings receive priority during call-center campaigns.

### 5. **Metrics for Project Success Evaluation**

Clearly define actionable metrics to assess the success of this classification project:

| Metric                      | How to Measure?                                   | Success Criteria               |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Lead Conversion Rate**    | Percentage of leads converted to meetings/clients | At least 10% improvement       |
| **Classification Accuracy** | Internal expert validation feedback               | At least 80% internal approval |
| **Sales Efficiency**        | Reduction in lead-to-client acquisition time      | Improvement by at least 15%    |

---

### 6. **Documentation and Stakeholder Alignment**

Clearly document these definitions in a concise project charter or internal knowledge base, ensuring alignment and agreement among all stakeholders:

**Project Charter Outline:**
